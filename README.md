# ATM Exercise

ATM Machine is a web-based simulator that replicates the basic functionality of an actual ATM. It's a simple and interactive project that allows users to practice depositing and withdrawing money virtually. The application is built with React and styled with Bootstrap, making it an ideal project for those who want to explore how banking applications work or learn more about frontend development.

## Features

* **Deposit Money:** Users can add money to their account balance by entering an amount and clicking the "Deposit" button.
* **Withdraw Money:** Users can withdraw money from their account by entering an amount and clicking the "Cash Back" button.
* **Interactive Interface:** Sleek and user-friendly design that provides a real ATM experience.
* **Balance Display:** Always stay informed about your current account balance, with real-time updates after every transaction.

## Installation

2. Open the `standalone.html` file in a modern browser.

## Improvements

* **Adding Validation:** Implemented validation to prevent users from withdrawing more money than their account balance would add more realism to the application.
* **Enhanced User Interface:** Modified the UI to require users to select either deposit or withdraw before an input field becomes visible. This would align more closely with the typical ATM workflow and enhance usability.  Also added styles to make it more user friendly
